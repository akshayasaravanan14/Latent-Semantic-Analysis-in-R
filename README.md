# Text Analysis with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in R

## Overview

This repository contains R code for performing text analysis using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA is a technique for analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. The script demonstrates how to preprocess text data, compute the term-document matrix, perform LSA, and visualize the semantic space in 2D and 3D.

## Requirements

- R 
- R packages: tm, ggplot2, lsa, scatterplot3d

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required R packages installed.
3. Run the R script `lsa_text_analysis.R`.
4. The script will perform text analysis using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and generate visualizations of the semantic space in 2D and 3D.

## File Structure

- `lsa_text_analysis.R`: R script containing the text analysis code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the relationships between the text documents and terms, visualized in a semantic space using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
